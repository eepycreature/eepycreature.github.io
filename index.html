    <p> Hey there, I’m Eepy</p>
    <p>I’m an aspiring artist, programmer and music composer. I try to be as friendly as I can, hopefully I am. 
      Frogs are awesome and adorable. If I sound awkward or weird in conversation or in the jokes I make its likely because 
      of my autism/ADHD combo, I’m trying my best to improve but don’t be afraid to call me out if I sound weird. 
      Here’s some of the stuff I like in case you’re interested.</p>
